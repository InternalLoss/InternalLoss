### Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student currently studying `Level 3 Diploma in Computer Science (Software Engineering/Digital Technology)` which is a lot of words to say "I'm a UK student at college."

My pronouns are *he/him*, and I have a website ~~that I haven't yet got set up~~ at https://billy.wales!

I'm a developer at [Insignia](https://billy.wales/404), a replacement server for the Xbox's online services, as well as a not-very-active dev at [Pretendo](https://pretendo.network), and at [REON](https://github.com/REONTeam) - in case you can't tell, I like network services ;P
