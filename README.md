### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a student currently studying `Level 3 Diploma in Computer Science (Software Engineering/Digital Technology)` which is a lot of words to say "coursework and theory in a classroom"

My pronouns are *he/him*, and I have a website ~~that's very rarely used~~ at https://billy.wales!

I'm a developer at [Insignia](https://billy.wales/404), a replacement server for the Xbox's online services, as well as a not-very-active dev at [Pretendo](https://pretendo.network), and at [REON](https://github.com/REONTeam) - in case you can't tell, I like doing networking stuff ~~though I don't think I'm too good at it.~~
