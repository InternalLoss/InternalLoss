### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a college student, currently studying a BTEC Level 3 Extended Foundation Diploma in Computing - hopefully a university student next year!

My pronouns are *he/him*, and I have a website ~~that's very rarely used~~ at https://billy.wales!

I'm a developer at [Insignia](https://billy.wales/404), a replacement server for the Xbox's online services, as well as a not-very-active dev at [Pretendo](https://pretendo.network), and at [REON](https://github.com/REONTeam) - in case you can't tell, I like doing networking stuff ~~though I don't think I'm too good at it.~~

My Twitter is [@InternalLoss](https://twitter.com/InternalLoss), but this isn't the best way to reach me - hello <at> my website domain is a much better way.
