### Hello! ðŸ‘‹

I'm a undergraduate student, currently studying a BSc in Software Engineering!

My pronouns are *he/him*, and I have a website ~~that's very rarely used~~ at https://billy.wales!

I'm a developer at [Insignia](https://insignia.live), a replacement server for the Xbox's online services, as well as a not-very-active dev at [Pretendo](https://pretendo.network), and at [REON](https://github.com/REONTeam) - in case you can't tell, I like networking!

My Twitter is [@InternalLoss](https://twitter.com/InternalLoss) and my Mastodon is [@internalloss@mas.to](https://mas.to/@internalloss), but these aren't the best way to reach me - hello <at> my website domain is a much better way.
